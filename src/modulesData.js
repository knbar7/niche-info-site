This program is not about deliberate practice so this won’t be exhaustive in it’s explanation, but to summarize, deliberate practice is made up of a mental image of what the skill to be developed looks like, and intentional and assessed (check word) practice. The process operates as a virtuous cycle. You have a mental image of what doing the skill well looks like, and you work toward being able to perform that skill. As you perform the skill you grow in understanding of what doing the skill well actually looks like. When we begin any activity, we rapidly improve in that skill with fairly little effort. For example, to get better at climbing when you have just started all you need to do is say “I want to climb better”; “climbing well” and the focus on that simple objective gives us enough to improve because we are starting from zero. Then, as we improve, we gain a deeper understanding of what climbing well really looks like, giving us greater understanding of our mental image, but also requiring a better mental image. Our ability to improve and our ultimate limit in skill development is determined by the quality of our mental images and our ability to work toward those mental images. `

This works for a while, but quickly we realize that there is more to climbing than pulling and using the correct holds. This work will aspire to provide the most cohesive and detailed writing of skilled climbing in existence. This will be done by expanding “climb well” into detailed explanations of the entire process of what makes up “climbing well”.

This all runs on autopilot using the subconscious mind, and your subconscious does a fantastic job at optimizing all of these tasks.

Moving the smaller parts of your feet is also beneficial when you need to fit your foot into a crack or other recessed part of the wall. With loose shoes, the foot is more malleable and therefore easier to get into these gaps. Loose shoes also make the process of gaining friction in those cracks and gaps more effective and more comfortable. Imagine taking a solid block of metal (or some other hard substance), putting it into a crack, and twisting it to force the corners in contact with the walls of the crack. Now, if we remember our conversation on friction, we will remember that friction is made up of surface area, direction of force, and magnitude of force. If we have a hard block with a very small surface area in contact with the walls of the crack, then the force must compensate for the lack of surface area. Bringing this back to the foot, just imagine how much harder and more painful building sufficient friction will be with the foot being forced into a stiff position. A malleable foot allows for increased surface area, which decreases the need for pressure, and results in less effort and less pain.`,

As the curve of the shoe straightens, the line from the toe to the heel, which is connected with a strap of rubber, lengthens. As it lengthens, some of the load is taken by the elasticity of the rubber strap, and the rest pulls on the heel. Through this pretty incredible process, the majority of sensitivity is maintained.

This principal means that an accessory appendage goes from 0 ft/lbs of force to 1 or higher. An accessory appendage is always capable of producing this amount of force. A supporting or stabilizing appendage, on the other hand, has to go from a starting force to a higher force (i.e., 80 ft/lbs to 81 or higher). These appendages may or may not be able to produce this extra force, and producing this extra force is highly taxing and will not be receiving a rest in the new position.`,

First, imagine where your center needs to be in the next position, second, move your center away from that point within your base of support, third, move toward your destination. As you move forward, but before you reach the end of your stable zone, remove the point of contact that you intend to move. At this point, you should be moving toward the new position. If you have done it correctly then you will be able to reach the next feature. When you get there, stabilize into the next position. The word deadpoint comes from the fact that there is a trajectory to a deadpoint. First you move one direction, but at a certain point you move back the other way. The moment that you switch from moving there to moving back is called the “dead-point” because at that moment there is no force in either direction. To experience this now, throw something upward into the air. You will see the object move upward, slow down, and at some point, stop moving, before it starts falling back down to earth. That point where it changes direction is the “dead-point”. If you can latch the next hold at that exact moment, you will experience greatly reduced force upon latching the hold.`,

Stand on the aforementioned features and move your hands at the same time using dynamic movements. The difficulty of this drill can be increased by doing the drill with one hand, using farther and/or smaller features for the hands, using smaller features for the feet, and increasing the angle of the wall you are performing the drill on. Increase the wall angle as a last resort once you have developed skill at the current wall angle because increasing wall angle will rapidly increase difficulty. Be aware that this drill is intended to teach deadpoint skills. It should not be excessively strenuous physically. If it is, then you have increased the difficulty too much and are in fact making it more difficult to gain skill.`,

This is a massive skill in climbing as it allows you to link positions that are otherwise unlinkable. The downside to deadpoints, however, is the short window of time that you have to latch the new hold. This requires precision and timing to get right. Missing the hold partially shifts the entire load to only part of a grip and therefore only some of your fingers, and missing the entire hold is instantly falling. Imperfect timing rapidly changes the forces experienced in the fingers as your backward/downward speed increases and multiplies to the initially required force. Partially supported positions are the solution to both of these challenges, and applying them well is arguably the most impactful skill there is in dynamic movement.`,

                            content: `As we have previously discussed, in any position there is a distribution of the total load spread out across all of the points of contact in use. This means that when you perform a deadpoint and land in your new position, only part of the load is going to be going through the new point or points of contact. The more fully you can occupy the position, and load the remaining points before hitting the new hold, then you can essentially slow down movement and only provide the necessary force through the new point of contact. This is effectively slowing down time. It gives you more time to be precise, and by resisting the backward acceleration decreases the impact of imperfect timing.`,

For this scenario, imagine that the rocket is like the cannonball in that it is launched using an initial force but it is then thrust forward afterward by a force that is not enough to propel the entire rocket, but is enough to support its upward trajectory. The cannonball is sent by an initial force from its resting point and lands with full force of downward acceleration, and the rocket is sent with the same initial force but loses speed more slowly due to the propellant, and, upon reaching its highpoint (its “deadpoint”) it accelerates back down to earth at a slower rate because part of the load is being pushed upward still. The result at the end of the day is a longer timeline for the trajectory of the object and a softer landing upon returning to the ground. Partially supported positions are the propellant (just like in the rocket) that slow backward acceleration and lengthen the time allowed to “land” on the new feature.`,
